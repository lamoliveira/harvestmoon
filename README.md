# Harvest Moon
  American lawns occupy over 30 million acres of land.<br> 
  Keeping these lawns green and manicured has a huge environmental impact.<br>
  Watering lawns is estimated to take from 30 to 60% of our drinking water.<br> 
  Homeowners typically use 11 times the amount of pesticide and fertilizers on their lawns as farmers do on their crops.<br>
  These toxic chemicals can go on to contaminate the food we eat and the water we drink.<br> 
  Luckily, Harvest Moon is here to turn these lawn into a colorful vegetable garden.<br>
  Lettuce help you Grow the food you Eat <br>
  and Share it with your Neighbors.
